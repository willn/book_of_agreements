INSTALL
---------
Obtain source from google's SVN repository, or download the tar/gzip archive.

Un-pack the archive in your document root:

	tar -xzvf book-of-agreements-0.2.tgz

Create a mysql database for your project, and create the tables:

	mysql -u username -p databasename < sql/boa.sql

Fill in the mysql connection information found in the config file:

	public/config.php

Fill in an email address in the various single-quote delimited spaces. Add a
name for your site, which will appear in the basic auth popup, for example
"Organization Book of Agreements".

Fill in sha1 passwords, you can use the sha1.php quick utility function to
generate these. Edit the file to list your desired password, then execute the
file:

	$ cat sha1.php 
	<?php echo sha1('password') . "\n"; ?>

	$ php sha1.php 
	5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8

	# edit your public/config.php file to make the array look like this:
	$Basic_Auth_Users = array( 
		'user' => '5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8',
	);

Fill in your mysql database connection info.

Using your mysql client, add some entries to your committees table. For
example:

	insert into committees values(1, 1, 'Buildings', 'buildings');
	insert into committees values(2, 2, 'Common House', 'ch');

You'll also want to download a copy of the tango icon library, and place the
32x32 directory in display/images/tango Instructions for downloading this
library either as an archive or the source can be found here:

	http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library

Direct download example:
	cd public/display/images/
	wget http://tango.freedesktop.org/releases/tango-icon-theme-0.8.90.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf tango-icon-theme-0.8.90.tar.gz
	ln -s tango-icon-theme-0.8.90/ tango
	rm tango-icon-theme-0.8.90.tar.gz

Now using your web browser, visit your website. There will likely be some
greeting text, but you'll need to click on the "Member Login" link in the upper
right corner in order to enter the application. Any username / password
combination that you defined in the $Basic_Auth_Users array will allow you to
enter the site.

In order to manage content, you'll need to then login as
the administrative user at the following URL:

	/?id=admin

and enter the password you used to generate the sha1 string you entered into
the $admin_string in the config.php page. From there, you should be provided
with links to add new minutes or agreements. Once you have documents
created, viewing them will show an "edit" and "delete" button to the page.
