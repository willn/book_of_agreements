The Great Oak garden be considered a shared resource and that the following items be included in the GO operating budget for Grounds:

1) The annual cost of woodchips for the paths (starting in 2012) -
$275/year.

2) Replacement hoses, splitters & sprinklers - $100/year.

3) The cost of installing a ,��water-only,�� meter - $500.  This will generate
an estimated savings of $560/year on sewer by having the water only meter.  The
meter will be installed in the hot box behind Hermann & Becky,�&#8482;s unit.

4) The cost of bringing a bigger diameter water line into the center of the
garden - $2300, which would allow for 6 sprinklers to be run at the same
time.

7) Gardeners will continue to pay to improve their own plot(s) as they
choose.

Pros:

'�      The garden will be treated as all other shared resources.

'�      Gardeners who could not previously afford a plot may try it out.

'�      Sewer costs will be reduced.

'�      The watering system will be more effective and efficient.

'�      The gardeners will continue to contribute to community meals.

'�      We will no longer be imposing on the residents in buildings 10 and 11.

'�      The new water line could also be used for the playfield.

Cons:

'�      It adds an additional expense to the operating budget.

'�      Not everyone will choose to have a garden plot.
