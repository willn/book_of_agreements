The Great Oak garden be considered a shared resource and that the following items be included in the GO operating budget for Grounds:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The annual cost of woodchips for the paths (starting in 2012) -<br>
<br>
$275/year.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Replacement hoses, splitters &amp; sprinklers - $100/year.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3) The cost of installing a ,water-only, meter - $500.  This will generate<br>
<br>
an estimated savings of $560/year on sewer by having the water only meter.  The<br>
<br>
meter will be installed in the hot box behind Hermann &amp; Becky,&#8482;s unit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4) The cost of bringing a bigger diameter water line into the center of the<br>
<br>
garden - $2300, which would allow for 6 sprinklers to be run at the same<br>
<br>
time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7) Gardeners will continue to pay to improve their own plot(s) as they<br>
<br>
choose.<br>
